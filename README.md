# Repository of camera simulation using package Chroma

This repository is a collection of files used to realize a camera simulation done by a brute-force optical photon simulation. 

In `installation` folder we have some Shell scripts written for installation on a cloud platform with an `Ubuntu 18.0` image. You may also make use of it to install chroma on other Linux machines. (By paraphrasing the scripts)

In `simulation` folder we have Python scripts used to realize the simulation, where we also include some guide on using the package. 

Both folders have a `README.md` explaining more details.
